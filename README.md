# Stone_Paper_Scissors_Game
This is Stone Paper Scissors game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was created as part of my web development learning process to gain hands-on experience with web design.

# How to Play:
-> You will have three options to choose from: Stone, Paper, or Scissors.
-> After making your selection, the computer will also randomly choose one of these options.
-> The game will compare both selections and announce the result.

# Winning Conditions:
-> Stone beats Scissors: Stone crushes Scissors.
-> Scissors beats Paper: Scissors cut Paper.
-> Paper beats Stone: Paper covers Stone.
-> Draw: If both you and the computer select the same option (e.g., both choose Stone), the game is a draw.
